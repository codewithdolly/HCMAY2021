1. What is use strict mode in javascript? List it's usage.
-To avoid creating a global variables accidentally inside a function because of omitting the var keyword, we use the "strict mode" by adding the “use strict” at the beginning of the JavaScript file or a function as well. 
-"use strict" eliminate some javaScript silence error and make our code run smooth and faster.
 - becauseits a  weird part of JavaScript we should always use "use strict" to avoid the errors.


2. What is variable shadowing?
    - Variable shadowing occurs when a variable of an inner scope is defined with the same name as a variable in the outer scope. 
        So here in shadowing, If you create variable name globely and redeclare the value in local variable. then if you invoke/call the value globely then it will take re-declared value. And that is called variable showding.

3. What is global variables?
    - JavaScript engine assigns variables that you declare outside of functions to the “Global execution context”. These variables are in the global variable. Also known as global Scope. 

4. What is local variables?
    - Local variable which we declare inside the function called local variable. Its also known as Locl scope.

5. What is Block scoped variables?
    -Block scope : Generally, whenever you see curly brackets {}, it is a block. Variables that you  declare inside a block are block scoped variables. 

6. What is undefined variables?
    -An undefined variable that has been declared, but we have not assigned it a value. So at that case it shows “undefined” as its initial value. and that is called undefined variable. || ex var num; ||We have declare the variable but didnot given value yet.

7. What is undeclared variables?
    -Undeclared variable is that has not been declared yet. 

8. Why JavaScript is loosely typed?
    -JavaScript variables are loosely typed, means variables can hold values with any type of data. for example:
        var fullName= "Rama Krishna"
            fullName= "John Andrew"
        So if you see the value JavaScript engine will show "John Andrew" instend of showing "Rama Krishna". and this thing happen because od loosely type. So basically loosely type takeing redeclared value.

9. Declare javascript variable using var keyword.
    - var fullName= "John Andrew"
