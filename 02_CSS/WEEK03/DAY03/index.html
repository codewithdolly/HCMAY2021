                       <p>Values of time are used to calculate the non-monetary costs incurred as part of a journey, so that the generalized cost of the journey (a combination of both monetary and non-monetary costs) can be calculated.

                        The value of time varies considerably from person to person and depends upon the purpose of the journey, but it can generally be divided into two sets of valuations: working time and non-working time. This division is appropriate because the value of working time (i.e. time spent traveling in the course of work) is calculated differently from the value of non-working time (i.e. time spent traveling outside work).
                        
                        For example, if a worker on a salary of £20 per hour travels to a meeting, the value of time in that case is £20 per hour, because that is the amount the employer would be willing to pay to reduce travel time (as travel time can be considered to be "wasted", i.e. not spent working).</p>
                    <h2>Non-working time</h2>
                    <p>This is time spent outside our work, which might include journeys to and from work and leisure journeys. Since this time is not valued in a market, it can only be estimated from revealed preference or stated preference analysis techniques, where the real or hypothetical choices of travelers between faster, more expensive modes and slower, cheaper modes can be examined.

                        For example, if a traveler has a choice between a coach which takes six hours and costs £10, or a train which takes four hours and costs £30, we can deduce that if the traveler chooses the train, their value of time is £10 per hour or more (because they are willing to spend at least £20 to save two hours' travel time).</p>
                    <p>The value of time cannot be assumed constant over time. Time is a limited good and as productivity and income increase, the relative value of time increases as well.[3] Historically, the projection of the value of time has been closely linked to personal income growth, which in practical applications is typically approximated by GDP growth. </p>
