                    <td>
                        <li>Data sent by the POST method goes through HTTP header so security depends <br> on the HTTP
                            protocol. Its quite riscky because your information is secure by using HTTP. This method
                            <br> is a little safer than GET because the parameters are not stored in browser history or
                            in web server logs.
