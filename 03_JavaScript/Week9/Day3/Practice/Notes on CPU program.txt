--What is CPT?
    -CPU known as a Central processing unit. it also calles as a  central processor , main processor, processor. (In other word you can say if computer is a human then CPU is a mind of human.)
    -It is made of electronic circuts.
    -It performs the logic, arithmetic,  controlling and input/output operations given in the program.
    -Modern circuits are implementing on integrated circuits microprocessors .
  
--What is memory?
    - Memory means it is to acquire, store, retain, and later retrive 
    Information.
    -It is of 3 types of memory : 
    (1) sensory memory
    (2) short-term, and
    (3) long-term.

    (1) Sensory memory:
         It mean make up your ability to process and recall what u seeâ€¦..simply we can say if we look at something and we think what have I seen now.
  
    (2) Short-term memory:
        It is also known as active or primary memory.
        short- term memory has ability to store a small amount of information and for short period of time.

    (3) Long-term memory : 
        It can store the data permenantly. We can see whenever we needed.

-- What is operating system and kernel means?
    -Operating system :
        -It is the most important software that runs on a software.
        -It is a interface between a computer and user.
        -It manages the memory and process of its software and Hardware.
        -Each device has the operating system.
        
        -Types of operating systems :
            -Batch os
            -Time sharing os
            -Multiprocessing os
            -Real time os
            -Distributed os
            -Network os
            -Mobile os
             
    -Now let's talk about Kernel:
        -It is the central component of an operating system.
        -That manages operations of computers and hardware.
        -It manages operations of memory and cpu time.
        -It has complete control on the system.
        -It always resident in the memory.
        -It gives interaction between hardware and software.
