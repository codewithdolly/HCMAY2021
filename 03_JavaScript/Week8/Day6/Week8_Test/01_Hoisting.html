        <h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>
        <p> During the creation phase, the JavaScript engine moves the variable and function declarations to the top of
            your code. This feature is known as hoisting in JavaScript. hr<br><strong>There is 2 types of
                Hoisting:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Variable Hoisting</li>
            <li>Function Hoisting</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Variable Hoisting:</h3>
        <p>Variable hoisting also known as Global hoisting. In this javaScript Engin moves variables on the top of the
            script.</p>

        <h3>Function Hoisting</h3>
        <p>Like variable, Tje javaScript engine moves the variable on the top of the function. And Function Hoisting
            also known as a Local variable.</p>

        <p> Also In Function, if we donot declare the function and invoke/call the function. then it check Function
            hoisting first and then check in Global Hoisting as well.</p>

    </div>
    <script>
        console.log("Hello There!")

        var num = 10;
        var str = "Hello My name is Dolly Singh"
        function multiply() {
            for (var index = 1; index <= 5; index++) {
                console.log(num * [index]);
            }

        }
        multiply()

        //Here you can see that i haven't given the num value but it is taking out of the Function. and thats only called variable value.

        //Now this is for function hoisting, let me show you for Variable Hoisting.

        console.log(str);

        //So i have given "str value on the top and after that i have used function for outer use. and again now i am searching the "str". its searched and given the result which you can see here "Hello My name is Dolly Singh".

    </script>
