    <h1>Elon Musk</h1>
    <p>From <u>Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</u></p>
     <p><strong>Elon Reeve Musk</strong> FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is an <strong>entrepreneur and business magnate</strong> . He is the founder, CEO, and chief engineer at SpaceX; early stage investor,[note 1] CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. A centibillionaire, Musk is one of the richest people in the world.

     Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. Musk co-founded online bank X.com that same year, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.</p>    
     
     <h2>Early life</h2>
     <hr>
        <h3>Childhood and family</h3>
        <p>Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.[4] His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada,[5][6][7] but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer.[8] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[7][9] His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian,[10][11] and Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[12][13] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria and elsewhere,[12] a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.[14] Musk has become estranged from his father, whom he has described as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done."[14] He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.[10][15]</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[22] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.[23][24] While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed Musk to avoid mandatory service in the South African military.[25] Arriving in Canada in June 1989, Musk failed to locate his great-uncle in Montreal and instead stayed at a youth hostel. He then traveled west to live with a second-cousin in Saskatchewan.[26] He stayed there for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.[27] In 1990, Musk entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[28][29] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn); he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in physics from UPenn School of Arts and Sciences.[30][</p>

        <h3>X.com and PayPal</h3>
        <p><i>Main articles: X.com and PayPal</i></p>
        <p>In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.[47] The startup was one of the first online banks to be federally insured, and, within its initial months, over 200,000 customers joined the service.[48] The company's investors saw Musk as inexperienced and had him replaced with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[49] The following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to prevent unnecessary competition.[37][49][50] Founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel,[51] Confinity had its own money-transfer service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service.[45][52] Within the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference for Microsoft software over Linux created a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign.[53] Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[54][note 2] Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[56][57] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.7%—received over $100 million.[58]</p>

        <h3>SpaceX</h3>
        <p><i>Main article: SpaceX</i></p>
        <p>In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society. He was inspired by plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars and discussed funding the project himself.[62] In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow to buy refurbished Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and was even spat on by one of the Russian chief designers. The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. Musk instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[63] With $100 million of his early fortune,[64] Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May 2002.[65] As of 2021, he remains the company's CEO and also holds the title of chief engineer.[66] <br>SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low Earth orbit satellites in 2015 to provide satellite Internet access,[77] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[78] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.[79][note 3]</p>
